### Golden Rules  
- Useful Checklist  
- better than nothing  
- Shneiderman 8 Golden Rules:  
	1.  Strive for consistency  
		Consistent interfaces make it easier for users to learn and remember how to use an interface.  
	2.  Enable frequent users to use shortcuts  
		 Providing shortcuts can save time and effort for experienced users.  
	3.  Offer informative feedback  
		 Users should receive clear and prompt feedback on their actions and the system's response.     
	4.  Design dialogues to yield closure  
		 Dialogues should be designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end, so users feel like they have completed a task.  
	5.  Offer simple error handling  
		 Error messages should be clear, concise, and offer constructive solutions.  
	6.  Permit easy reversal of actions  
		 Users should be able to undo an action if they make a mistake.  
	7.  Support internal locus of control  
		 Users should feel like they are in control of the system, not the other way around.  
	8.  Reduce short-term memory load  
		 Users should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Instead, information should be presented in a clear, consistent, and organized manner.  
- Norman's 7 Principle  
	1. Use Knowledge in **World** and **Mind**  
	2. Simplify the structure of tasks  
	3. Make things visible  
	4. Get mappings right  
	5. Explocit the power of constraints, natural and artificial  
	6. design for error  
	7. when all else fails, standardize  
  
  
## 7-Advanced Topics  
  
  
### Universal  
- Meaning:  
	- The process of design products canbe used by  
		- as many people  
		- as many situation  
- Principle  
	- Equitable Use  
		- appealing to all
		- Everyone as same one  
	- Flexibility Use  
		- Allow for a range of ability andpreference  
	- Simple and intuitive  
		- support user's expect and accommodate diff lang  
	- not complex  
	- facilitate access to important  
	- provice prompt and feedback  
	- Perceptible info  
	- proveide effect communication of info regard env condition or the user;s ability  
	- Tolerance of error  
	- Low Physical Effort  
	- Comfortable to use, min physical effort and fatigue  
	- Size & Space for approch and use  
  
  
### Socio-org issues and Stakeholder requirements  
- Why  
	- Prople in group have conflict goal  
- How  
	1. Identify Stakeholders  
	2. consider requirements and design for every stakeholder
