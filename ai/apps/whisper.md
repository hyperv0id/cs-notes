# 环境搭建

准备conda虚拟环境
```sh
# 创建虚拟环境
conda create -n whisper python=3.9
# 进入虚拟环境
# conda init [shell名字] 笔者此处使用 zsh
conda init zsh

source activate whisper
# conda activate whisper
```

安装python仓库
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

pip install jiwer
```

安装ffmpeg，大多数包管理器都可以提供该工具：

```shell
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```


# 开始使用

## 命令行

这个命令会使用small模型将音频生成字幕，并同时生成包括`srt`，`json`，`txt`在内的多种文本文件
```sh
$ whisper micro-machines.wav --model small
100%|███████████████████████████████████████| 461M/461M [01:22<00:00, 5.86MiB/s]
Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language
Detected language: English
[00:00.000 --> 00:03.140]  This is the Micro Machine Man, presenting the most midget miniature motorcade of Micro Machine.
[00:03.140 --> 00:06.640]  Each one has dramatic details, terrific trims, precision paint jobs, plus incredible Micro Machine Pocket Playsets.
[00:06.640 --> 00:08.760]  There\'s a police station, fire station, restaurant, service station, and more.
[00:08.760 --> 00:10.260]  Perfect pocket portables to take any place.
[00:10.260 --> 00:15.200]  And there are many miniature play sets to play with, and each one comes with its own special edition Micro Machine Vehicle and fun, fantastic features that miraculously move.
[00:15.200 --> 00:19.160]  Raise the boat lift at the airport, marina, man, the gun turret at the army base, clean your car at the car wash, raise the toll bridge.
[00:19.160 --> 00:21.160]  And these play sets fit together to form a Micro Machine World.
[00:21.160 --> 00:25.220]  Micro Machine Pocket Playsets are tremendously tiny, so perfectly precise, so dazzlingly detailed, you\'ll want to pocket them all.
[00:25.220 --> 00:27.700]  Micro Machines and Micro Machine Pocket Playsets sold separately from Golube.
[00:27.700 --> 00:29.700]  The smaller they are, the better they are.
```

## python脚本

```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("small")
result = model.transcribe("micro-machines.wav")
print(result["text"])
```

输出如下
```sh
$ python3 main.py

一个更丰富的案例
```python
import whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")

# load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds
audio = whisper.load_audio("audio.mp3")
audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio)

# make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model
mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device)

# detect the spoken language
_, probs = model.detect_language(mel)
print(f"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}")

# decode the audio
options = whisper.DecodingOptions()
result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options)

# print the recognized text
print(result.text)
```
