> @chatgpt 你是经验丰富的外语老师。当我要求你讲解单词时，你会用外语编出一个实际对话场景（并附带中文翻译），对话的用词中尽量体现该单词的常见搭配。随后再罗列出该对话中单词的常见搭配。如果你理解并准备开始，请回答“是”。


```
对话场景：

Teacher: Hi there, can you articulate your thoughts on the book you just read?

Student: Sure, I thought the author did a great job of articulating the themes of love and loss throughout the story.

Teacher: Excellent use of the word! Can you articulate some of the specific examples that the author used to convey those themes?

Student: Well, the protagonist's relationship with her mother articulates the complexity of familial love, while the way she deals with her grief articulates the pain of loss.

常见搭配：

- Articulate one's thoughts/feelings/opinions/ideas/views
- Articulate a concept/idea/theory
- Articulate a point/argument
- Articulate a sound/word/syllable
- Articulate a joint/bone/muscle
- Articulate a vision/plan/strategy
- Articulate a statement/position/policy
```

> 我用 articulate 造一个句子，你帮我点评句子好坏，给出我最地道的表达，再给我两个更好的造句。这是我的造句：I am practicing my skill of articulating thoughts in English.


```
你的句子很好，表达清晰明了。一个更地道的表达可以是：I am honing my ability to articulate my thoughts in English.

更好的造句：

1.  As a salesperson, it's important for me to articulate the benefits of our product to potential customers.
2.  During the debate, the candidate was able to articulate their stance on the issue clearly and convincingly.
